Five Websites that are "RESPONSIVE"

www.barackobama.com 

The audience for this website are the people of the world who are interested in 
Barack Obama and his plans. They can also visit the website to stay up to date with 
the latest happenings.

To adapt from a 'website' to a 'mobile' or a smaller screen size the main image 
located on top of the website scales to a smaller version. Some of the aritcles that 
had a small amount of information showing below their title are scaled down to just a 
link. 

http://www.anderssonwise.com/

Anderssonwise is an architecturial group. The website shows a portfolio of their 
projects that have been completed since their startup. 

Going from a regular version to any re-adjustable version their website rescales all 
the images. The links also adapt to the size of the screen.
